### Register request

```
curl -d "username=<username>&password=<password" "local:8000/authentication/register/"
```
The respose will be like

```
{
    "access_token":"<token>",
    "expires_in":36000,
    "token_type":"Bearer",
    "scope":"read write",
    "refresh_token":"<refresh_token>"
}
```


### Login request

```
curl -d "username=<username>&password=<password" "localhost:8000/authentication/token/"
```

The response will be the same as the register response

### Refresh request

```
curl -d "refresh_token=<refresh_token>" "localhost:8000/authentication/token/refresh/"
